# Visually-Guided Agent


Agent and tasks set up.

(*A*) Agent. Sensory neurons (blue) are interconnected to interneurons (black), then which are in turn connected to the two motor neurons (red). The interneurons are recurrently interconnected. The nervous system is bilaterally symmetric.

(*B*) Task 1: Object-size discrimination task. The agent moves horizontally while a circle of different size falls from above. The rays of the agentâ€™s proximity sensors are shown in dashed blue.

(*C*) Task 2: Perceiving affordances task. The agent moves horizontally while a wall with an adjustable aperture falls from above.
